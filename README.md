# NLP-and-DataVisualisation
This project unables us to understand the data better.
In the research paper TextRank:bringing order into texts, it is mentioned that the TextRank algorithm is better than the then state of the art algorithms
Here we are trying to implement Textrank algorithm an Health and Tourism data sets and the same data set is implemented on the data visualisation software GEPHI
We will compare the results of both the methods and hence will prove that the results are improved by using the graph method rather than TextRank implementaion itself.
